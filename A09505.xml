            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The fyrſt is, (which we read in Geneſis) the oblation of Melchiſedech, vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of nature.

The holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Dauid ſygnified no leſſe vnto vs. And in manyfeſt wordes declared, that the preeſthode of Melchiſedech prefigu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red,

This preeſt, (meanyng Chriſt) after the order of Melchiſedech, remayneth a preeſt for euer.

And for as muche, as the offyce of preeſthode conſyſteth, in offeryng vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to God oblations &amp; ſacrifices, (as ſaint Paule is wytnes.)

And for as muche as,
<pb facs="tcp:19801:32"/>
ther is none other oblacyon (where in he anſwereth vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifice of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſedech) ſaue only, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifice of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye &amp; blood, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of bread &amp; wyne, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> venerable ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it foloweth ryght wel, that the offryng of Melchiſedech, was a very euident fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the holy ſacrament.

            <p>For where I ſayde, that ther was none other ſacrifyce, that anſwered to the fy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guratyue ſacryfice of Melchiſedech,<note place="margin">Leui. 16.

For the bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt, (whych was the ende of al figuratyue ſacryfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) offered vpon the croſſe, by death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were prefygured &amp; were the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tipical oblacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Melchiſedech. But to this I anſwere, &amp; playnly ſaye, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, Chriſt, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, by the effuſion of his precious blood, fulfylled rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloodie ſacryfices of the olde law, whyche were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effuſyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of beaſtes blood, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crewel ſlaughter of calues &amp; gootes (offered vp yerely in the feaſt of expiacyon) was very euidently <g ref="char:abpre">p̄</g>fygured Chriſtes ſacrifice vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe
<pb facs="tcp:19801:32"/>
and that moche more playnly, then cold the offrynge of bread &amp; wyne by Melchi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſedech. And thus there is no more reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why Chriſt (by thys ſacryfice) ſhuld be called a preeſt accordyng to the order of Melchiſedech, then after the order of Aaron. Yeas certaynly, (wyll he ſaye) for ſai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Paule ſheweth reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why. For in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was kynge of ſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay of peace) he figured Chriſt,<note place="margin">Hebre. 8.</note> our onely peace maker. Again like as melchiſedech had neyther father neyther mother, begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng neither endyng, (expreſſed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture), is likened (as ſaint Paule ſayth) vnto the ſone of god, which remayneth for euer.

<pb facs="tcp:19801:33"/>
not only in that he was kynge of ſalem (that is to ſay of peace) and in that he was eternall, but he fygured alſo, the preeſthode of Chriſte. And this maye playnly apere, by the wordes of Dauid. For he ſayde not onely. Thou art euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtynge or eternal, accordyng vnto the order of Melchiſedech, but he ſayde.</p>
            <p>Thou art a Preeſte for euer, accordyng vnto the order of melchiſedech. The ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſtle Paule, in that place, in tendeth to proue, the ceſſacion and neceſſarye tranſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation, bothe of the lawe, &amp; of the leuity call preſthod, in to the newe eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelycal &amp; perpetual preeſthod, accordyng to the order of melchiſtedech. Certaynly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth nothing, vnto the preſthode, of Melchiſedech, to be kinge of Salem, ether to haue, neither father or mother, neyther begynnynge neyther endyng.</p>
            <p>For it folowyth not. By cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech was king of Salem, and had, neyther father or mother, neyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyg neyther endynge, therfore he was a preſte. Wherfore, in theſe thingꝭ, Melchiſedech fygured the perpetuite and eternite of Chriſtes perſone, who hath, neyther begynnynge neyther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge (as concernynge hys diuynitie) rather, then the preiſthode of Chriſte, and therfore ſaynt Paule ſayth, theſe expreſſe wordes.

And thus ſaynt Paule proueth Chriſte to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally a preeſt accordyng to the order of Melchiſedech, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thys preeſthod ſhuld not be for a tyme, as the other leuiticall preeſthod was, but ſhulde remayne for euer.

            <p>By cauſe (therefore) that the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues were weake in fayth, and lacked

excerciſed wittes, the apoſtle Paule let paſſe &amp; wolde not entreate ſo hyghe and harde a myſtery, amonge ſuche baby ſhe people. And for this cauſe, the holy apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle thought it ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the purpoſe, in that place to proue, the preeſthode of Chriſte ꝑpetual, by the prophecie of Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uid, and though it alſo conuenient, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge ſuche lewd &amp; ignoraunt people, to leaue the declaration, of ſo hyghe a matter. For vndoubtedly, lyke as Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech, hauyng no begynnynge ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endynge, fygured Chriſtes eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (wherof thappoſtle intreated) euen ſo dyd he alſo, prefigure Chreſtes preeſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hode in his figuratiue ſacrifice of bread &amp; wyne, of the which thapoſtle ſpake no thinge, bycauſe of the weaknes of their capacitie and the hardnes of ſo hyghe &amp; matter. And yet certaynly, Chriſte ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fylled the fyguratiue ſacrifice of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dye thurſday, when he (eatynge the paſchall la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be with hys diſciples) made an ende, both of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſſe ouer &amp; preeſthode, &amp; ſet in place the ꝑfect ſacrifice of his bodie &amp; blood in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of bread &amp; wyne, and the perpetual preeſthode, accordynge to the order of Melchiſedech.

            <p>In the ſame .x. chapter the holy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath alſo, theſe wordes. We ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (ſayth he) are but one bread, and one body, euen as many as, partake of one breade. In theſe wordes the appoſtle ſheweth, that as many as, doth partake of that one bread, ſo many are one body

in Chriſte. Yf the apoſtle ſhulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, by thys one bread, material bread, it had neade to be, an exceadynge greate loffe, that ſhulde fede corporally, all the whole bodye of Chriſte, ſpred and ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keled abrode, in ſo many and ſondry pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of the worlde. It can not therfore be anye one materiall breade, whereof, all the lymmes and membres of Chriſt, do partake, and are (thereby) made one bodye.

And thys bread (whorthely eaten) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them all (by that partakynge) but one, where euer they eate it.

And that (I ſaye) by thys corporall eatynge and receyuynge of hys bodye and bloode in the holye ſacrament. ¶And certaynly (mooſte chriſten reader) it maketh not a lytell, for the veritie of the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, of Chriſtes bodye in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that it is not ſufficient for vs, to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue, that we (receyuing this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t)

For we are membres of hys bodye of fleſhe and of hys bones. ✿ By theſe wordes, ſaynt Paule teachith vs, that Chriſte dothe feade and cheryſheth hys church, not onely ſpiritually, but alſo corporally, &amp; that may wel appere, by the wordes of S.

But euery man doth not cheryſhe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, his owne fleſhe, with ſpirituall foode (for the fleſhe is not fedde wyth ymaginations &amp; beleue of good meate) but rather with the corporall receate &amp; eatynge, of very and naturall meate. Then doth not Chriſte fead hys church onelye wyth ſpirituall foode, but alſo he feadeth corporally hys church, with the very meate of hys fleſhe and blode.

For S.

And that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe (without doubt) by the eatynge of that meate, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſt doth noryſhe vs with al, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the effecte of

that myghty meate, and moſte delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foode, to tranſforme the eater, into his mooſte bleſſed fleſhe and bones. And certaynely it is, not breade (as I haue ſayd) eather any other meat, wherwith Chriſt fedeth, and cheriſheth vs corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and that can (by eatynge therof) incorporate vs, vnto the naturall body of Chryſt, and make vs of his bones, ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uynge onely, the natural body and blod of our ſauyour Chriſt.

Thus theſe apoſtolyke fathers, moſt erneſtly, &amp; mooſte aſſiduouſly wreſteled, againſt the hateful enemyes of the euangelical and catholyke faythe. Wherfore, yf they hadde beleued, that the bodye

Neather wolde they in open ſynode, and generall conſell, haue condempned it, for an horible he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſye. Wherefore it is then, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that they beleued, the very reall preſens of Chriſtes body and bloode, in the ſacrament.</p>
            <p>The ſecond veritie is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> none of theſe fathers, neather any of the other catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyke wryters, eyther taught, eyther wryt, that the body and blode of Chriſt was not really in the ſacrament, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ought not, ſo to beleue, but paynly they wryte the contrarye, as ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere here after. ✿</p>

            <p>✿ Wauerynge or doubtful (ſayth ſaint Auguſtyne) I conuert and turne vnto Chriſte, for hym I do ſeke.

For he toke earth of earth (for fleſhe is but earth) and of the fleſhe of Marye, he toke fleſhe. And in the ſame fleſhe, he was here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and gaue vs the ſame fleſhe to eate, for our health. There is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that eateth that fleſhe, but wyll fyrſte worſhyppe it wyth godlye honoure. And thus is it founde and perceaued, howe the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole of our Lord, is honoured with god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye honoure. And not onlye, we do not offende, in ſo honourynge it, but we do offende, yf we do not ſo honour it. Thus dyd, theſe mooſte godly and deuout fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, teache the people, where in they playnly ſignified and ſhewed, that they beleued, the reall preſens of the bleſſed bodye and bloode of Chriſt in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. And it is not to be thought that they taught colorablye one thynge, and wryt another, neither can any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> read, in any of theyr monumentes or wrytin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that they eyther taught or wryt the contrarye, of the catholike fayth, of the

very reall preſens of Chriſte in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. But that they wryt moſte ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfeſtlye, for the ſame veritie, (as ſhall appere here folowynge.

            <p>The thyrde veritie is, that what ſo euer he be, that beleueth not, the reall &amp; verye preſens, of Chriſtes body &amp; blood, in the ſacrament, that ſame pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trewe church of Chriſt, but is, rather of the ſynagoge of ſatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therfore in the ſtate and peryll of dampnation, for he that retayneth not, the whole faythe catholyke of Chriſte, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame is none, of the trew membres of Chriſtes churche.

               <p>Wherfore all thys inculcation and the oft reherſall, and repetition, of hys go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge awaye from the worlde, and from the apoſtles, is no more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of his lyfe, and conuerſation, and of the ſtate of hys body, that where that they had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viſible and mortal conuerſation of hys bodye (that bodye beynge onely in earthe) here after the ſame ſhulde be

               <p>For in thys ſort of arguyng, we myght conclude, and proue, that there were neather bloode, nether wyne, but onelye a cuppe.

For ſaynt Paule do call the ſame, the body of our Lorde, twyſe, in the ſame chapter.

For he ſaith Chriſte had a greate deſyre to eate hys Paſſeouer, not (ſayth he) the Paſſeouer that was the ſlaughter of ſhepe (for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was Moyſes paſſeouer) but thys, he cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led hys, by cauſe that in thys was hys owne naturall fleſhe and bloode, and in the other the fleſhe and blood of a ſhepe Yf ther had ben nothynge els, in thys, then breade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fygure of his fleſhe, why
<pb facs="tcp:19801:112"/>
ſhulde he call this more his, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whiche was alſo a more expreſſe fygure of his death, then the bread and wyne were. Furthermore Tertulliane, ſayth that Chriſt made the bread (that he toke, and dyſtrybuted to hys dyſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) hys bodye, ſaynge. Thys is my bodye. In theſe wordes he moſte aperte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, ſheweth that Chriſte made the bread hys bodye. Yf ther be none other thyng there, then breade, neyther no alteracy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ther, in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then ther was before, I maruayll what thyng, Chriſt dyd make. But Tertullianes wordes be to playne, to be deludyd, or doubted of, for he confeſſeth that Chriſte made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breade, his bodye, ſaynge. This is my bodye. But that wordes, that foloiuith ſemeth to haue all the dyfycultye, by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe Tertulliane added, that is to ſay the fygure of hys bodye. And in lyke ſorte, alſo ſaynt Auguſtine (Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyanes contre man) callyth it a fygure.</p>
               <p>✿ No dougth, but it is very trew, that the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is a fygure, an, exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, a ſygne, and token of the bodye of Chriſte. For euery ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is a fygure or example and ſacrate token of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thynge.

For as moche as, in the bleſſed ſacrament (which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very ſacrifice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche catholyke) is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned in two dyſtinct formes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, of bread &amp; wyne &amp; the ſame bleſſed bodye &amp; blood y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was offered vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe in ther own lyknes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in lyke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of fleſhe &amp; blood, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame bodye and blod vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of bread &amp; at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſſe lyfted vp in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayer ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſtes hed it is a token or a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>branc, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, the ſame body (in the tyme of Chriſtes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) dyd hang vpon the croſſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayer and was ſo offered vp (by death) for our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, &amp; the ſame body &amp; blood con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained reali alſo vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhape or forme of wyne &amp; lyffted vp (at the ſacrynge of the maſſe) it is a token callyng vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brans how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſed blood was ſhed, on hye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſynnes.

<pb facs="tcp:19801:113"/>
Thus is the bleſſed ſacrament (where in is contayned verely the bodye and blood of Chriſt (a ſygne a fygure a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or example of the death of Chriſt. And in this conſideration the fathers (ſome tyme and that very ſeldome) dyd cal it a ſygne or fygure. And in thys ſort we graunt no leſſe. But that it is, but a fygure, onlye a fygure or nothynge els the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a figure. That we vtterly deny. For neither in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture, neyther in any ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholyke wryter can they fynde, that the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is called, only a fygure or but a fygure, or any lyke ſaynge. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though they named it a figure or a token, yet they playnlye declare and ſhew, that they beleued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> very real pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſens of the bodye and blood of Chriſt in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as I haue ſhewed bi their owne wrytinges. So I conclude and anſwere that though the ſacrament be a ſygne or a fygure, yet neuertheleſſe it is verely &amp; really the verye bodye and bloode of Chriſt, therfore is it not only a fygure or onely and nothinge els then a fygure, or a ſygne. Thys anſwere (in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) is ſufficient for all ſuche places that they can brynge in, of anye of the auncyent wrytters.</p>

For he dyd not onely gyue the holy gooſt, but he gaue power to other myniſters to gyue the holye gooſte, as Paule dyd alſo to Tymothe and Tyte.

Wherfore ſaynt Paule wyllynge to reforme thys errour, he reuoketh them, vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyderation of the myniſters, and what they dyd, in that myniſterie, and what and how muche god wrought. And ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What is Appollo, or what make you of Paule? They are but the myniſters of hym, in whome you haue receaued your fayth. And then by a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of huſbandry, he declareth vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them, what they do in theyr miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion and what almyghtye God dothe, and ſayeth.

Euen ſo I anſwere vnto theſe, what is the preeſt? ſaue onely the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of him, that ſayd vnto hys apoſtles Do thys? That is to ſaye: That thynge that you haue ſene me do nowe. Take the breade geue thankes and ſaye theſe wordes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread, that I haue ſayd, &amp; receaue or eate it, in the remembraunce of me. The preeſt onely ſpeaketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des (as the miniſter) in the perſone of Chriſte, and he, that fyrſt of bread made hys owne bodye, that ſame now, at the wordes and myniſterie of the preeſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth his bodye, and blood. So that the preeſt maketh, not God (which can not be made other then he is all redye) ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bodye of Chriſte, thoughe it be ther, in the ſacrament. No more then he doth remyt ſyn and geue the holy gooſt by cauſe that God workyth the forgeue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of ſynnes and geueth the holy gooſt in the mynyſtery of the preeſt. But it is god that worketh theſe thynges in this mynyſterye and makyth of bread (in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrament) the bodye of Chriſte, by hys ſecrete and omnipotent power, euen as he (by the ſame power) made that ſame bodye, in the whom of a virgine, and as
<pb facs="tcp:19801:116"/>
he doth inuiſibly waſhe the ſoule of him whome the preeſte baptyzyth: Whye then (you wyll ſaye) the myniſterie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preeſt is not neceſſarie, ſythe God doth al. Yet remember y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, S. Paule ſheweth, howe, we are goddes, helpers and yet (no doubt) but that god can do, &amp; dothe all the whole, yet, not wythout our my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie (not of neceſſitie) but that there might be an order in thinges. Wherfore breuely we anſwere that the preeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not God, but god almightie, in the myniſterie of the preeſt by the myghty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power of hys worde, ſpoken by the preeſt, maketh of bread the body &amp; blood of Chriſt. And thus ought we to beleue, be it neuer ſo muche againſt nature, and neuer ſo farre aboue reaſon. For vnto hym (that is omnipotent and Lorde of nature) it is poſſible. For he can alter na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, when hym pleaſeth, and do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thynges innumerable, that infy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nytely tranſendeth the blynd reaſon of man, of the which thynges, this is one.

Yet is it is very trew, and poſſible, vnto
